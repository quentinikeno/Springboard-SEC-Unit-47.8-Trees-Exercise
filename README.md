# Trees Exercises

## Description

Methods written for a TreeNode and BinaryTreeNode class as part of Springboard's Software Engineering Career Track.

> ### Trees
>
> Here are descriptions of the methods you should write for Tree:
>
> #### sumValues
>
> Given a n-ary tree of integers, return the sum of all the integers.
>
> #### countEvens
>
> Given a n-ary tree of integers, return the count of all the even integers.
>
> #### numGreater
>
> Given a n-ary tree and a number x, find and return the number of nodes which are greater than x.
>
> ### Binary Trees
>
> Here are descriptions of the methods you should write for BinaryTree:
>
> #### minDepth
>
> Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth. The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from root node down to the nearest leaf node.
>
> #### maxDepth
>
> Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth. The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from root node down to the nearest leaf node.
>
> #### maxSum
>
> Given a binary tree, find the maximum path sum. The path may start and end at any node in the tree, but no node can be visited more than once.
>
> #### nextLarger
>
> Given a binary tree and a integer x. Find and return the value of the node with next larger element in the tree i.e. find a node with value just greater than x. Return null if no node is present with value greater than x.
>
> #### areCousins
>
> Given a binary tree and two nodes, determine whether the two nodes are cousins of each other or not.
>
> #### Serialize / Deserialize Binary Tree
>
> Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. Implement both of these methods as statics on the BinaryTree class.
>
> #### lowestCommonAncestor
>
> Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

## Tests

Install and run tests using NPM:

```
npm install
npm test
```
